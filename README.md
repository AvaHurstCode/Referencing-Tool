**Project Outline - Overview:**
A tool for artists to help organise references and colour schemes across many projects

**Project Outline - Background:**
After 11 years of experience as a 3D Artist, image and colour references have become essential to my workflow for each of my projects. There are some tools out there such as PureRef which are handy for individual projects, however I often find myself working with 3 or 4 projects simultaneously, and managing the references between these projects, or finding colour schemes which match these images can be troublesome and timely
